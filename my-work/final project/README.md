# Finall Project ðŸ‘¾ - Done ðŸ˜†

## Oh, superhero? How much?

The idea for this project starts from the wondering of how much should I pay if I want to legally buy Iron Man. The fact is we will never have an accurate number because it is impossible to calculate for that. The franchise of superheroes is across cross multiple business markets not only focusing on the movies but also like toys and bags. However, though we might not be able to get superhero's money value formally, we can have a rough picture of what we want through indirect methods. This is exactly the reason for having Robert Theory.

## ðŸ’¯ Robert Theory (2019)

TR = RRS + RJS * PL

TR - Total Revenue (for a certain movie)

RRS - Revenue of Personal Series (movies that include the superhero's name)

RJS - Revenue of Joint Series (movies that not include the superhero's name)

PL - Proportion of Lines (a certain superhero's lines/total lines )
