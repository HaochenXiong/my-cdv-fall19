# Finall Project 👾 - Done 😆

## 💰 Oh, superhero? How much?

The idea for this project starts from the wondering of how much should I pay if I want to legally buy Iron Man. The fact is we will never have an accurate number because it is impossible to calculate for that. The franchise of superheroes is across cross multiple business markets not only focusing on the movies but also like toys and bags. However, though we might not be able to get superhero's money value formally, we can have a rough picture of what we want through indirect methods. This is exactly the reason for having Robert Theory.

## 💯 Robert Theory (2019)

TR = RRS + RJS * PL

TR - Total Revenue (for a certain movie)

RRS - Revenue of Personal Series (movies that include the superhero's name)

RJS - Revenue of Joint Series (movies that not include the superhero's name)

PL - Proportion of Lines (a certain superhero's lines/total lines )

## 💡 Explanation of the Theory

Of course that this theory is not "right" because how often a superhero says definitely can not stand for the money value he has for the movie. But we can not deny that this theory can give us a quick view of how much revenue that a superhero get for the whole Marvel universe. Also, it is interesting collect data from lines because it might give us other insights that we did not know before.

## 📣 Data Visualization

Two visualization are included in my project.

### 1️⃣ Renvenue Proportion

Here you can see the renvenue of several superhero that has been calculated from the Robert Theory.
