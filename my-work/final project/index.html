      <p class="pOne">As its movies become more and more popular all around the world, Marvel has created a huge universe that contains dozens of superheros.
      However, the emphasis on its narrative of characters and also the story cross the movies has minimized the fact that they are all business movies that
      being made to make money. It is easy to get the box office of a certain movie or the whole genre, but we never have a clear picture of how much profit
      a single superhero has made for the whole universe. We can not deny that all the characters created in the movie have their own value beyond money but
      only if we get to know how much they contribute to the universe we can get to understand the reasons and dynamics of keeping circulating them in the mass
      culture. For this purpose, I have created my own theory (Robert Theory) to help us calculate how much profit a certain superhero has made from Marvel movies
      (only the movies):
      <p>
      <p class="pTwo">
      Total Revenue = Revenue of Personal Series + Revenue of Joint Series * Proportion of Lines
      </p>
      <p class="pThree">
      The results from the theory are definitely not that accurate but worthy to analyse. Since it is impossible to calculate a rigorous number, this theory can give
      us a rough and quick pictire of what we want to know. Through data visualization, we will have a clear look at those superherosâ€™ economic benefits, compare them
      with each other, and finally get insights from those data.
