## Three Quotes from New Dark Age: Cloud

> Schmidt, one of the worlds most powerful facilitators of data-driven digital expansion, with a crowd of global business and government leaders as his audience, is not merely wrong, but dangerously so.

I found this sentence interesting because the author emphsized Schmidt's identity again at the end of this argument. It is ironic that as "one of the worlds most powerful facilitators", what limited Schmidt was exactly his professional understanding. Just like the author mentioned, he was not wrong. Instead, his thoughts is dangerous because he did not consider the political economy of his expectation on smartphones. Technology itself is neutral, but how we, as human, are going to use it is not. It is hard to avoid its conflict with our politics, economy and morality.  

> ...data is not something that is freely given but forcibly extracted.

This sentence might be a little exaggerated, but it is true. For individuals without centain power, data is not something freely to get. However, on the contary, their own data can be easily collected and used even without their notification. The flourish of data do create an uneven relationship of power within the society but this divide does not only appear on data. In fact, it is the human inequality that we have been fimiliar with since centuries ago. This is exactly why the author defined it as a repeat. Data is just another carrier to show human bias and attitudes.

> Ultimately, strategy for living in the new dark age depends upon attention to the here and now, and not to the illusory promises of computational prediction, surverillance, ideology and representaton.

This sentence reminds me of the movie Matrix. It is esay and cosy to live in a technology fantacy while the truth might be cruel. The key is not about the knowing that it may be only a fantacy, but your response to that. Just like the fight happening in the movie They Live, sometimes it is ourselves that prefer to believe an ideology. Not every one can be Neo but at least you need to try. The way that the author provided with us is to think. I do agreee with this because through thinking we might have the chance to find the problems under the fantacies just like what the author did in the chapter.
