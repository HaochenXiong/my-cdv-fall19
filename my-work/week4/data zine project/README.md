# üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èIntroduction
In this project, I visualized the notifications I received on my phone between 4 to 5 everyday from 11th Sep to 17th Sep. All the data I collected are formed and stored in these two files: [json](https://github.com/HaochenXiong/my-cdv-fall19/blob/master/my-work/week4/data%20zine%20project/data1.json) and [csv](https://github.com/HaochenXiong/my-cdv-fall19/blob/master/my-work/week4/data%20zine%20project/data.csv).

## Cover
The cover looks like an actual cover with titles and a hand painted phone.

## Middlespread
In the middlespread page, y-axis stands for the date and x-axis stands for the minute when I received that notification. Hand painted icons are the apps where those notifications came from.

## Back
The charts in the back page show the proportion of the types of notifications that I received in a day.
