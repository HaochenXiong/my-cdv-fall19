# Week 7 - Research: 3 datasets that I find interesting

## 1 - [Number of train passengers in China from 2008 to 2018 (in billions) 🚄](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276054/number-of-train-passengers-in-china/)

I am interested in this dataset because the railway transportation here in China had a huge development in the past decade. Without looking at the real statistical chart, I know there must be a growing number of train passengers. However, it will be more interesting if I can visualize it through the comparison with other datasets like the road transportation, air transportation, and even train transportation in other countries like America.

## 2 - [Video Game Industry 🤩](https://www.statista.com/topics/868/video-games/)

Here is a great fact about me: I LOVE VIDEO GAMES!!! This web page includes a lot of interesting data about the video game industry around the world and I'd like to visualize some of them. For example, what are the most popular games and how much profits can each of them make per year? By using these datasets, my project can be the one going deep into the industry and make people know more about the facts behind different video games.

## 3 - [Costs and revenue of Marvel movies 🦸🏻‍♂️](https://www.statista.com/statistics/323886/marvel-comics-films-production-costs-box-office-revenue/)

We can not deny the popularity of superhero movies in the mainstream culture. It seems like the public focus more on their content but in fact they are all commercial films to make huge profits. If this will be my project, I will also use other datasets like revenue of Marvel movies in different countries and also datasets about DC Comics. It will be interesting to visualize those data to figure out a business model behind.
